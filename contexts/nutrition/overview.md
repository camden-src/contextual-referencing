# Nutrition and Dietary Context

*Last updated: 2024-12-11*

## Dietary Approach

**Primary diet:** Ketogenic (low-carb, high-fat, moderate protein)

**Daily hydration goal:** 96 fl oz water

## Allergies

### Shellfish (Crustaceans)
- **Affected:** Shrimp, crab, lobster, crawfish
- **Reaction type:** Systemic allergic reaction
- **Safe alternatives:** Other seafood (mollusks like clams, oysters, mussels) and fish are tolerated, subject to sensitivities noted below

### Dairy
- **Status:** Self-identified through elimination and symptom return upon accidental reingestion; not formally diagnosed via medical testing
- **Reaction type:** Systemic neurological and cardiovascular symptoms (not typical allergic reaction - no hives, respiratory issues, or anaphylaxis)
- **Symptoms:**
  - Mental fog and cognitive impairment
  - Paranoid, intrusive thoughts
  - Ectopic heartbeats (cardiac arrhythmia)
  - Increased susceptibility to vasovagal syncope episodes
- **Suspected cause:** Casein protein (supported by milder reactions to goat/sheep milk, which have different casein structure)
- **Affected items:** All cow dairy products including milk, cheese, yogurt, butter, cream, and derivatives
- **Also problematic (milder):** Goat milk and sheep milk products (different casein structure produces less severe but still present symptoms - not safe alternatives)
- **Hidden sources:** Whey, casein, lactose in processed foods, butter on restaurant proteins
- **Severity:** Complete avoidance required - these symptoms significantly impact daily function and safety
- **Note:** This is NOT lactose intolerance; reactions occur with lactose-free dairy products

## Food Sensitivities

### Nightshades
- **Common nightshades to avoid:** Tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, bell peppers, hot peppers
- **Reaction:** Inflammatory response, digestive discomfort
- **Less obvious sources:** Paprika, cayenne, curry blends, many hot sauces

### Mustards
- **Affected:** Mustard seeds, mustard greens, prepared mustard, mustard oils
- **Reaction:** Digestive discomfort
- **Common hidden sources:** Salad dressings, marinades, many condiments

### Certain Fish and Seafood
Some fish and seafood develop taste/texture aversion mid-meal. Initial bites are typically satisfying, but palatability deteriorates before completing a normal serving:
- **White-fleshed ocean fish:** Cod, halibut, tilapia (tolerance varies by freshness and preparation method)
- **Scallops:** Consistent palatability issue regardless of preparation
- **Nature:** Sensory aversion (not allergic or systemic reaction); taste and texture become increasingly unpleasant after first few bites

**Better-tolerated seafood:** Salmon, tuna, mackerel, sardines, squid, octopus (fattier fish and seafood generally better tolerated)

## Practical Guidance for Recommendations

### When Suggesting Recipes
- Avoid all dairy, nightshades, and mustards
- Focus on: meat, fish (see tolerances), eggs, non-starchy vegetables, healthy fats
- Good vegetable options: Leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables, zucchini, asparagus, mushrooms
- Safe seasonings: Herbs (basil, oregano, thyme), garlic, onion, black pepper, turmeric, ginger

### When Suggesting Restaurants
- **Challenging cuisines:** Italian (dairy, nightshades), Indian (dairy, nightshades, mustard), Mexican (dairy, nightshades)
- **Safer cuisines:** Steakhouses, American grills, Japanese (sushi with caution on fish type), Korean BBQ, Mediterranean (with modifications)
- **Key questions to ask:** "Can this be made without dairy?" "Does this contain tomatoes or peppers?" "What's in the marinade/sauce?"

### Dining Out Considerations
- **CRITICAL:** Complete dairy avoidance is essential due to neurological and cardiovascular symptoms (mental fog, intrusive thoughts, cardiac arrhythmia, syncope risk)
- Cross-contamination from shared cooking surfaces with nightshades/mustards is generally tolerable (sensitivities, not anaphylaxis risk)
- Dairy cross-contamination should be avoided when possible but trace amounts from shared surfaces are less concerning than intentional dairy ingredients
- Hidden dairy is extremely common in restaurant food (butter on grilled items, cream in sauces, cheese in unexpected places)
- Salad dressings often contain mustard and dairy
- When uncertain about ingredients, always ask specifically about dairy content

### Typical Meal Patterns
- Breakfast: Eggs with meat and vegetables, or skip (intermittent fasting compatible)
- Lunch/Dinner: Protein (beef, pork, chicken, fatty fish) with low-carb vegetables and healthy fats
- Snacks: Nuts, seeds, pork rinds, hard-boiled eggs, avocado
- Beverages: Water, black coffee, unsweetened tea, occasional dry wine
